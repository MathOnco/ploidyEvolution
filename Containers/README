We align sequencing reads to NCBI Human Reference Genome Build 38 using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner, version 0.7.10, with default parameter settings. PCR duplicates were eliminated using Picard 2.19. GATK 4.1.2.0 was used for base quality recalibration and for joint tumor/normal indel realignment. No GC bias correction was performed. Inherited variants for each normal sample were obtained with GATK UnifiedGenotyper (2.2-16-lite) and allele frequencies in tumor and normal were calculated using in-house Perl scripts. To calculate clone-specific copy-numbers applied the HATCHet algorithm, which simultaneously detects clonal copy number across multiple tumor samples. HATCHet and GATK are packed in Singularity containers, and pipelines are run using the WDL/Cromwell workflow language for transparency and reproducibility.
